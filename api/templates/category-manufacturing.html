      <h2>Manufacturing Workers at High Risk for Asbestos-Related Diseases</h2>
      <div class="card card-primary">
        <p>Industrial manufacturing plants across the United States extensively used asbestos-containing materials from the 1940s through the 1980s. These facilities represent some of the highest concentrations of occupational asbestos exposure in American industrial history. Manufacturing workers routinely handled raw asbestos fibers and worked in environments saturated with asbestos dust from insulation, machinery components, and protective equipment. The combination of high-temperature industrial processes and the widespread use of asbestos for heat resistance created particularly hazardous conditions that have resulted in thousands of mesothelioma and asbestos-related disease cases among manufacturing workers and their families.</p>

      <h2>History of Asbestos Use in Manufacturing (1940s-1980s)</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>The American manufacturing boom following World War II coincided with the peak use of asbestos in industrial applications. Manufacturing facilities relied heavily on asbestos for its fire-resistant and insulating properties, particularly in high-temperature processes involving furnaces, boilers, and industrial ovens. Major manufacturing corporations knowingly exposed workers to dangerous levels of asbestos fibers despite mounting evidence of health risks beginning in the 1930s. Internal company documents revealed during litigation show that many manufacturers actively concealed the dangers of asbestos exposure from their workforce while continuing to use asbestos-containing materials well into the 1980s. This widespread use has left a lasting legacy of asbestos contamination in manufacturing facilities across the nation.</p>

      <h2>Health Risks and Legal Rights for Manufacturing Workers</h2>
      <div class="grid">
        <div class="card card-danger">
          <h3>Health Risks</h3>
          <p>Manufacturing workers faced extreme asbestos exposure levels, often working in poorly ventilated areas where asbestos fibers accumulated to dangerous concentrations. Studies have shown that manufacturing workers have some of the highest rates of mesothelioma, lung cancer, and asbestosis among all occupational groups. The latency period for asbestos-related diseases means that workers exposed decades ago are still being diagnosed today. Family members of manufacturing workers also faced secondary exposure from asbestos fibers brought home on work clothes, leading to mesothelioma cases among spouses and children who never worked directly with asbestos.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card card-primary">
          <h3>Legal Context</h3>
          <p>Manufacturing companies have faced extensive litigation for knowingly exposing workers to asbestos without adequate warnings or protection. Major manufacturers have paid billions in settlements and jury awards to victims and their families. Many companies filed for bankruptcy protection and established asbestos trust funds to compensate current and future victims. Workers and their families may be entitled to compensation through multiple sources including workers' compensation, personal injury lawsuits, and asbestos trust fund claims. The statute of limitations for filing claims typically begins at diagnosis, not exposure, recognizing the long latency period of asbestos-related diseases.</p>
